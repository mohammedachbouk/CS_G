# Software engineering at scale
Mohammed Achbouk entry for computer science project 
![coverage badge](./coverage.svg)

The docs site is live at 

the aim of the project is to try and get as close as possible to a production-like software porject by utilizing the tools and methods we explored as part of the refresher in computer sciences.

The project is built into three main sections:

1. The [data] section contains the data provided.
2. The [new_solutions] most recent versions of the solution.
3. the [old_solutions] older version of the solutions
4. The [tests] section contains all the unit tests.

- Note: 
 > As the partitionning of this project indicates, i included an older version of the solution which works to some degree if executed manually but it is very unsatisfactory and unprofessional. So after inquiring from different groups, i managed to build the newer solution.

To run the new solution, create a new folder named solutions containing Users.txt for the output  
The project was built using poetry and documented using sphinx, with some automated Github actions for test and things of such.
